BackgroundColor.vim - A simple Plugin to color your background

I) Directory layout 
=====================
This repository contains the Join.vim plugin, the unit tests and the 
documentation. The current directory structure looks like this:

doc/
plugin/
autoload/
Makefile
README

The subdirectory doc/ contains the documentation for the plugin.
The subdirectory plugin/ contains the Vim plugin and the autoloaded
file is located below autoload/

II) Installation
===============
Simply put backgroundColor.vim in your plugin directory. (e.g.
~/.vim/plugin/) Create directories, that do not exist currently.

III) Documentation
==================
BackgroundColor.vim only works, if your vim is compiled with signs-support.
If it is, you can use signs, to define a background color for your text.

This plugin defines these Commands:
:Red Color the selected Range red
:White Color the selected Range white
:Yellow Color the selected Range yellow
:Blue Color the selected Range blue
:Green Color the selected range Green
:Black Color the selected range Black
:Custom1
:Custom2
Color the selected range with your defined Color1 or 2
Those 2 commands are only defined, if you have specified a color for this
command.
You can define a custom color using the 2 variables g:bg_color_custom1 and
g:bg_color_custom2

:Clear Clear the selected range
:ClearAll Clear the whole buffer of all background colors.

All commands (excep :ClearAll, which only uses the whole buffer) accept a
range, on which they operate. So you can use, e.g. :%Red to color the whole
buffer red.

I am not sure if this is really useful, but in case you find it usefull,
please rate this plugin.
